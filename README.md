# STL-10 Utils
## http://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/

Forked from mttk/STL10

Code modified a little to extract and save train, test and unlabaled sets all in one go.

The usage is relatively straightforward, the file `stl10_input.py` contains all the necessary methods for downloading and reading data along with a test main funct for displaying an image.
